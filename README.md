# Auction Sale Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the auction sale prices of machinery using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes detailed information about the machinery, such as manufacturing year, usage hours, and various machine configurations. The goal is to build a model that minimizes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to achieve a better score in the competition.
