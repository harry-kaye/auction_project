Overview
The goal is to predict auction sale prices for heavy machinery using historical auction data. To achieve this, we'll follow these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the structure of the data.
Visualize and analyze key features.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical values.
Drop non-numeric columns.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features from existing data.
Select the most relevant features for the model.
Model Training and Validation:

Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train a RandomForestRegressor model.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Evaluate the model using RMSE.
Prediction and Submission:

Use the trained model to predict prices on the validation set.
Generate a CSV file with predictions for submission.
Analyze Feature Importance:

Determine which features contribute the most to the modelâ€™s performance.
