Overview
The goal is to predict auction sale prices for heavy machinery using historical auction data. To achieve this, we'll follow these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the structure of the data.
Visualize and analyze key features.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical values.
Drop non-numeric columns.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features from existing data.
Select the most relevant features for the model.
Model Training and Validation:

Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train a RandomForestRegressor model.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Evaluate the model using RMSE.
Prediction and Submission:

Use the trained model to predict prices on the validation set.
Generate a CSV file with predictions for submission.
Analyze Feature Importance:

Determine which features contribute the most to the modelâ€™s performance.

Explanation of Each Stage
Stage 1: Data Loading
Why: Download the datasets from Google Drive and load them into pandas DataFrames.
What: Used gdown to download the files and loaded them into DataFrames, specifying dtype to avoid warnings.
Stage 2: Data Exploration and Visualization
Why: Understand the dataset, visualize distributions, and identify missing values.
What: Displayed basic information, visualized the distribution of the target variable.
Stage 3: Data Preprocessing
Why: Clean the data by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns to prepare for modeling.
What: Dropped columns with more than 50% missing values, kept only numeric columns, and filled remaining missing values with the median. For the validation set, filled numeric columns with the median and non-numeric columns with the mode.
Stage 4: Model Training
Why: Train a baseline RandomForestRegressor model to predict auction sale prices.
What: Split the data, trained the model, and calculated RMSE on training and validation sets.
Stage 5: Permutation Feature Importance
Why: Identify the most important features impacting model predictions.
What: Calculated and visualized permutation feature importance, then retrained the model after dropping the least important features. Also displayed the feature importance in a table.
Stage 6: LIME for Model Interpretation
Why: Provide an explainable AI approach to understand how each feature impacts the model's predictions.
What: Used LIME to explain individual predictions and visualize feature importance. Displayed the LIME explanation as a plot and in text form.
Stage 7: Hyperparameter Tuning
Why: Optimize the model for better performance by finding the best hyperparameters.
What: Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters and retrained the model with those parameters.
Stage 8: Regularization
Why: Prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model.
What: Added parameters like min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf and evaluated the model.
Stage 9: Evaluating Different n_estimators
Why: Understand the effect of the number of trees in the forest on the model's performance.
What: Trained the model with different n_estimators values and evaluated RMSE. Also displayed the RMSE results in a table.
Stage 10: Final Submission
Why: Generate predictions for the validation set and save the results.
What: Created a timestamped submission file and saved it.
